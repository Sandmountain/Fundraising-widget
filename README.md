### Code Case Fundraising widget (frontend exercise)

This exercise was completed using React.JS.
The few design changes made from the original was that the form was changed to take up the full width of the container,
as well as changing the size. These changes made the component's design look more coherent as well as increasing the visibility of the interactable elements.
